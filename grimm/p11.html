        <p>Whither away, Hans.  To Gretel, mother.  Behave well, Hans.
Oh, I'll behave well.  Good-bye, mother.  Good-bye, Hans.  Hans
comes to Gretel.  Good day, Gretel.  Good day, Hans.  What good
thing do you bring.  I bring nothing, I want something given me.
Gretel presents Hans with a young goat.  Good-bye, Gretel.
Good-bye, Hans.  Hans takes the goat, ties its legs, and puts it
in his pocket.  When he gets home it is suffocated.  Good evening,
mother.  Good evening, Hans.  Where have you been.  With Gretel.
What did you take her.  Took nothing, she gave me something.  What
did Gretel give you.  She gave me a goat.  Where is the goat, Hans.
Put it in my pocket.  That was ill done, Hans, you should have
put a rope round the goat's neck.  Never mind, will do better next
time.</p>
