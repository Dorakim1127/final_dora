            <p> When they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said,
now, children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you
may not be cold.  Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together,
as high as a little hill.  The brushwood was lighted, and when the
flames were burning very high, the woman said, now, children,
lay yourselves down by the fire and rest, we will go into the forest
and cut some wood.  When we have done, we will come back and
fetch you away.

Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate
a little piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the
wood-axe they believed that their father was near.  It was not the
axe, however, but a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree
which the wind was blowing backwards and forwards.  And as they had
been sitting such a long time, their eyes closed with fatigue, and
they fell fast asleep.  When at last they awoke, it was already dark
night.
