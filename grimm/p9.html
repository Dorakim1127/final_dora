Not long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout
the land, and the children heard their mother saying at night to
their father, everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left,
and that is the end.  The children must go, we will take them
farther into the wood, so that they will not find their way out
again.  There is no other means of saving ourselves.  The man's
heart was heavy, and he thought, it would be better for you to share
the last mouthful with your children.  The woman, however, would
listen to nothing that he had to say, but scolded and reproached
him.  He who says a must say b, likewise, and as he had yielded the
first time, he had to do so a second time also.
