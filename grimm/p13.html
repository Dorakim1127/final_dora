        <p>  Whither away, Hans,  to Gretel, mother.  Behave well, Hans.
Oh, I'll behave well good-bye, mother.  Good-bye, Hans.  Hans
comes to Gretel.  Good day, Gretel.  Good day, Hans.  What good
thing do you bring.  I bring nothing, I want something given to
me.  Gretel presents Hans with a piece of bacon.  Good-bye,
Gretel.  Good-bye, Hans.
Hans takes the bacon, ties it to a rope, and drags it away
behind him.  The dogs come and devour the bacon.  When he gets
home, he has the rope in his hand, and there is no longer
anything hanging to it.  Good evening, mother.  Good evening,
Hans.  Where have you been.  With Gretel.  What did you take
her.  I took her nothing, she gave me something.  What did
Gretel give you.
Gave me a bit of bacon.  Where is the bacon, Hans.  I tied it to
a rope, brought it home, dogs took it.  That was ill done, Hans,
you should have carried the bacon on your head.  Never mind, will
do better next time.</p>
