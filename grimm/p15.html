        <p>  Whither away, Hans.  To Gretel, mother.  Behave well, Hans.
I'll behave well.  Good-bye, mother.  Good-bye, Hans.  Hans
comes to Gretel.  Good day, Gretel.  Good day, Hans.  What good
thing do you bring.  I bring nothing, but would have something
given.  Gretel presents Hans with a calf.  Good-bye, Gretel.
Good-bye, Hans.
Hans takes the calf, puts it on his head, and the calf kicks his
face.  Good evening, mother.  Good evening, Hans.  Where have you
been.  With Gretel.  What did you take her.  I took nothing, but
had something given me.  What did Gretel give you.  A calf.
Where have you the calf, Hans.  I set it on my head and it
kicked my face.  That was ill done, Hans, you should have led
the calf, and put it in the stall.  Never mind, will do better
next time.
