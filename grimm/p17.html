        <p>  Whither away, Hans.  To Gretel, mother.  Behave well, Hans.
I'll behave well.  Good-bye, mother.  Good-bye, Hans.
Hans comes to Gretel.  Good day, Gretel.  Good day, Hans.  What
good thing do you bring.  I bring nothing, but would have
something given.  Gretel says to Hans, I will go with you.
Hans takes Gretel, ties her to a rope, leads her to the rack and
binds her fast.  Then Hans goes to his mother.  Good evening,
mother.  Good evening, Hans.  Where have you been.  With Gretel.
What did you take her.  I took her nothing.  What did Gretel
give you.  She gave me nothing, she came with me.  Where have
you left Gretel.  I led her by the rope, tied her to the rack,
and scattered some grass for her.  That was ill done, Hans, you
should have cast friendly eyes on her.  Never mind, will do better.
