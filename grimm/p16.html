        <p> The witch came out and kindly offered the children the cookie house. The children were so hungry and ate the house. Then, the witch lured the children into the house by offering some more food. The witch was actually lying! 
            She wanted to eat the children as her treat! 
            So the witch locked Hansel in a cell and fed him to make him nice and chubby so he would be tasty.
