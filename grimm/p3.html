            <p> The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and
had heard what their step-mother had said to their father.  Gretel
wept bitter tears, and said to Hansel, now all is over with us.

            <p>Be quiet, Gretel, said Hansel, do not distress yourself, I will soon
find a way to help us.  And when the old folks had fallen asleep,
he got up, put on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept
outside.  The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay
in front of the house glittered like real silver pennies.  Hansel
stooped and stuffed the little pocket of his coat with as many as he
could get in.  Then he went back and said to Gretel, be comforted,
dear little sister, and sleep in peace, God will not forsake us, and
he lay down again in his bed.</p>
