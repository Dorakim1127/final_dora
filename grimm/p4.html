            <p> When day dawned, but before the
sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the two children, saying
get up, you sluggards.  We are going into the forest to fetch
wood.  She gave each a little piece of bread, and said, there is
something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then, for you
will get nothing else.  Gretel took the bread under her apron, as
Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket.  Then they all set out
together on the way to the forest.  When they had walked a short
time, Hansel stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so
again and again.  His father said, Hansel, what are you looking at
there and staying behind for.  Pay attention, and do not forget how
to use your legs.  Ah, father, said Hansel, I am looking at my
little white cat, which is sitting  up on the roof, and wants to say
good-bye to me.  The wife said, fool, that is not your little cat,
that is the morning sun which is shining on the chimneys.  Hansel,
however, had not been looking back at the cat, but had been
constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones out of his pocket
on the road.
